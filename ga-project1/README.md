                        BEGINNING OF PROJECT PLAN

API USED - MERRIAM WEBSTER COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY API
    Data Features: Definitions, Synonym and Usage paragraphs, possibly illustrations once past mvp. 

    Key Value Pairs: 
        "id" : word searched for
        "def" : definition
        "examples" : example use cases of the word


USER STORY - 
The user is someone who wants to look up words and customize their 
own word practice lists without going through the effort of making their
own flash cards through a site such as Quizlet. 

HOW SHOULD PEOPLE BE ABLE TO USE YOUR WEBSITE -
When they get to the site, they should be able to look up a word and see the definition of that word as well as examples for the word. They can then interact with the word by adding it to their word list, which will make the word appear as a flash card at the bottom of the screen. There can be up to 10 flash cards at a time. 

WIREFRAMES - Included in planning folder

MVP TECH REQUIREMENTS- 

1) Use AJAX to make a request to external data source and insert data
retrieved into DOM

    Using Merriam Webster API and displaying id, def, examples on site

2) Implement Responsive Design (fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile)

    wireframes planned out for mobile and desktop

3) Have on or more complex user interface modules built from scratch using jQuery. 

    For MVP, I'll be making the flash card section of the page a 
    carousel. Initially, the user will be able to click on the word
    they searched in order to trigger the creation of the flash card. 
    I will insert a limit that they can only create five flash cards 
    at a time. 

PAST MVP PLANS

-   Once I reach the MVP, I will try to add a drag 
    and drop feature - the user can drag the word over to the 'word
    list' section in order to trigger flash card creation. Limit 
    will be increased to ten flash cards. 
-   Add pulling of illustrations to the site from API
-   Try to add local storage for word list and flash cards so that 
    user can keep their previous cards on the site and load 5-10 
    new ones each day.
